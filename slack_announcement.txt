lattice-sub v1.5.3 Released — Live Watch Mode is Here!

Hi everyone,

The live processing feature I've been working on is now available on PyPI.

What's New in v1.5.x

Live Watch Mode with --live Flag
• Continuously monitors input directory for new files as they arrive
• Hybrid approach: batch processes existing files with all GPUs first, then switches to single-GPU watch mode for new arrivals
• Clean real-time counter updates in place
  (e.g. "Processed: 105/105 files | Avg: 0.3s/file | Latest: filename.mrc")
• File debouncing handles partial writes (2 second delay)
• Press Ctrl+C for graceful shutdown

Real-World Test (Shenron — 4× RTX 2080 Ti)
• 100 existing files batch processed in ~2 minutes 48 seconds
• 5 files added during batch processing automatically queued
• All 105 files processed correctly with accurate counter display
• Watch mode processes new files as they appear (~0.3s per file)

Perfect For
• Processing motion-corrected files during overnight data collection
• Real-time monitoring of lattice subtraction results
• Automated pipelines that need to keep pace with upstream processing

Upgrade
pip install --upgrade lattice-sub

Usage
Standard batch (unchanged):
lattice-sub batch input/ output/ -p 0.56

NEW live watch mode:
lattice-sub batch input/ output/ -p 0.56 --live

• Changelog: https://github.com/gsstephenson/cryoem-lattice-subtraction/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

For those running data collection sessions, this should eliminate the need to manually re-run batch processing as new files arrive. Let me know how it works for your workflows.

Go forth and subtract (continuously).
